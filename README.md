=== Hi there 👋 === 

I'm Nity 
I won't disclose any name, sex, age, or location cause i'm not comfortable with that for now 🤷‍♀️

I'm an low-tier IT student interested in leveling up my coding skills as it's something i like  

I - try to - learn __Python, JS, HTML/CSS, C and Bash__ 🕷

My presence here is just meant for browsing other people's project, to ~~copy paste~~ __take inspiration__ from them until i'm ready to make something __trully__ useful for myself and you all. 

I use a debian based-distro for coding, as well as VSCodium ( which I recommend ).
